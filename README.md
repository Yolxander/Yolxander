### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

    Im Yolxander a curious and passionate Developer than enjoys working with front-end technologies as much as the back-end ones.

 ðŸ˜„ I like learning how to incorporate new technologies to my work and future projects. My favorite lenguages are Javascript and PHP so I spend most of the time practicing and working on projects that include frameworks that make use of these lenguages.

  âš¡Im a huge fan of MVC universe. MVC universe?! Im glad you asked. similarly to DC universe(from the commics) that has superheros like Batman and Wonderwoman, MVC has superframework like Laravel and Angular that have being saving and protecting the world with their special features. 
  
  ðŸ”­ When Im not coding or playing video games, Im trying a new cooking recipe or reading science books. Btw I recomend you reading "Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows, it helped me look at coding from a different angle.
